# CircularRoadDynamicProgramming

This is a Challenge for weighted probability and dynamic programming challenge

Challenge : A Circular road has N positions, labled 0 through N-1 where adjacent positions
are connected to each other and position N-1 is connected to 0. M cars start at position 0 through M-1(inclusive).
A car can make a valid move by moving forward one position (or goes from N-1 to 0) if the position it is moving to 
is empty. at each turn only consider cars that have a valid move available and make one of the valid moves that 
you choose randomly with equal probability. After T rounds, we compute the average(A)and standard deviation(S) 
of the position of the cars


now compute 

What is expected value of A when N = 10, M = 5, and T = 20?

what is the standard deviation of A when N = 10, M = 5, and T = 20?

What is expected value of s when N = 10, M = 5, and T = 20?

what is the standard deviation of S when N = 10, M = 5, and T = 20?

What is expected value of A when N = 25, M = 10, and T = 50?

what is the standard deviation of A when N = 25, M = 10, and T = 50?

What is expected value of s when N = 25, M = 10, and T = 50?

what is the standard deviation of S when N = 25, M = 10, and T = 50?
